Introduction

After using many different task management applications available on the app store, none found that fulfill the daily task management in a simplistic and intuitive manner.
I have found the need personally for this simplistic application. An application that makes it easy to record tasks and subtasks, intuitively have them completed throughout the day, and potentially renew themselves into the next day if necessary.
This saves the effort of deleting long processes for tasks and having to untick then re complete tasks each day. This application is simplistic in nature, as it should be. As an individual, I find it unnecessary to have all these additional features like time tracking, note taking, etc. 
Perhaps the marketplace shares in this sentiment around the task management application scene. This MVP of the KeepYourWord application aims to test this hypothesis.

Hypothesis:
Everyday workers want a simple and intuitive task management application that allows them to manage their daily tasks in a visually appealing and easy way.

Aim: 
To determine whether everyday workers want a simple and intuitive task management application that allows them to manage their daily tasks in a visually appealing and easy way.
